# hitachi_Beamer_Remote
With this script you can power on/off a Hitachi CP-WX Projector over the network.


Change the `IP=` to the ip of your projector.

Then run the script, 
for power on:
`beamer_on_off.sh --on`

for power off:
`beamer_on_off.sh --off`








Thanks to Marco Schmalz for coding that script
